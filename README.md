# CityGMLConverter
CityGMLConverter is a plugin for 3DCityDB Importer/Exporter (http://www.3dcitydb.org/) which converts the citygml datasets directly to KML/Collada without the need to import citygml file into spatial database.
It is an alternative tool for those users who need quick KML/Collada exporter.
